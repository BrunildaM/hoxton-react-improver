This is going to be a React Project where the users can get daily price updates of the crypto coins.
Using one of many free API available, I can get the crypto price details and everything in JSON.
I will implement a search bar where users can search coins by providing the coin names.

- Sort Coins by price or %


Things to be done

- Adding a form to create new Coins
- Have a sign up button for users
